# Genral Rules

Here are some basic instructions for contributions. Try to follow them, even
when maintainers sometimes may forget to follow them ("Do as I say, not as I
do")

- Docs have to be similarly formatted like the std docs
- No unsafe code unless approved by mainatiner and gated by "unsafe" feature
  (Add it when no one exist yet)
- Commit Prefixes:
  - changes only consiting of doccomment changes: "doc: "
  - mdbook (/docs/) changes: "book: "
  - test chances: "test:"
  - examples "ex: "
  - added features "feat: "
